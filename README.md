# Case Study: ATM Machine
## White Belt (Beginner Level)
### Problem Statement
In this case study, we will be building a basic ATM machine that allows users to perform simple banking transactions such as withdrawing cash and checking account balance.

ATM Machine Features:
- View account balance
  
  Implement a function to display the user's account balance.
- Deposit cash  
- Withdraw cash
  
  Implement a function to deduct the requested amount from the user's account balance.  
  Implement error handling for invalid account information or insufficient funds.

### Implementation
Create a new Git repository and set up a basic file structure with index.html and main.js files (*Notes: it will be better if we create a branch for each level*).

Use HTML and CSS to create a simple user interface for the ATM machine, including input fields for the user to enter their account information and transaction details.

In main.js, write a function to handle the submission of the account information form, which should make an asynchronous network request to retrieve the user's account balance.

Display the user's account balance on the screen using ECMAScript 6+ features such as template literals.

Write a function to handle the submission of the transaction form, which should deduct the requested amount from the user's account balance and display the updated balance on the screen.

Use callbacks to ensure that the network request for the user's account balance is completed before processing the transaction request.

Implement error handling for invalid account information or insufficient funds.

Use Bash commands to test the application locally and push changes to the Git repository.
